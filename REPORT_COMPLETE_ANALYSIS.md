- **Limited Insights:** Lack of data-driven decision-making for healthcare management
- **Payment Inefficiencies:** Manual billing processes causing delays and errors

### **Key Objectives**
1. **Digitalize Patient Records:** Create a unified Digital Health Card system
2. **Streamline Appointments:** Enable online booking, rescheduling, and cancellation
3. **Integrate Payment Systems:** Support government coverage, insurance, and private payments
4. **Enhance Accessibility:** Provide mobile/web access for patients and staff
5. **Enable Analytics:** Deliver insights through dashboards and automated reports
6. **Ensure Security:** Implement robust authentication and role-based access control
